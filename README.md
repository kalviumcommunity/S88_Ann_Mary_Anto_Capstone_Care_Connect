Care-Connect

Schedule Nurses to Your Home

A Full-Featured Platform for Home-Based Healthcare

Description

Care-Connect is a web platform that connects families to qualified and verified nurses providing home care services, whether for post-surgical recovery, elder assistance, or long-term care solutions. Care-Connect makes it simple to Search, Schedule, and Manage nurses through its comprehensive online platform solution, all in one place.

Problem Statement

Many families are unsure where to search and ultimately rely on friends or outdated printed directories. Conversely, many certified nurses have difficulty securing flexible opportunities for jobs where their skills are needed. In both instances, there is a clear disconnect between patients and providers — there simply is not a secure, centralized, trustworthy platform that matches home-based healthcare. Care-Connect is here to help close the gap. Our platform is easy to use, safe, and affordable, and puts power into the hands of families who need care and nurses looking for meaningful work.
